## Project Overview

**Calmly** is a comprehensive mental health and well-being platform designed to bridge the gap in accessible and stigma-free psychological support for college students.

- **Confidential Self-Assessments:** Clinically validated PHQ-9 (Depression) and GAD-7 (Anxiety) tests with instant, private results.
- **AI-Powered Chat Support:** A 24/7 AI companion (powered by Google Gemini) for immediate guidance, with built-in crisis detection.
- **Personalized Dashboard:** A central hub to view assessment history, book appointments, and access the AI chatbot.

### For Institution Admins:
- **Secure Admin Portal:** A separate, secure dashboard for institution administrators.
- **Therapist Management:** A simple interface to add, view, and remove certified therapists for the institution.
- **Anonymized Analytics:** A powerful analytics dashboard with charts (powered by Recharts) to visualize anonymized student well-being trends, severity distributions, and platform engagement over time.
